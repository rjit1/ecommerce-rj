# üöÄ Apply Database Fixes - RJ4WEAR E-Commerce

## Critical Database Issues Fixed

### 1. RLS Policy Issue (Order Creation Failing)
**Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "orders"`

**Root Cause**: Restrictive RLS policies preventing guest users from creating orders

**Solution**: Updated RLS policies to allow both authenticated and anonymous users to create orders

### 2. Guest Checkout Support
**Issue**: Guest users cannot place orders
**Solution**: Modified policies to support guest checkout while maintaining security

---

## üîß How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query

### Step 2: Run Migration 002
Copy and paste the following SQL and execute it:

```sql
-- =============================================
-- MIGRATION: Fix Order RLS Policies for Guest Checkout
-- Version: 002
-- Date: 2024-12-19
-- Description: Fix RLS policies to allow guest users to create orders
-- =============================================

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create order items" ON order_items;

-- Create new policies that allow both authenticated and anonymous users to create orders
CREATE POLICY "Allow order creation for all users" ON orders
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow order items creation for all users" ON order_items
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Ensure RLS is enabled but allows the above policies
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE order_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add a policy to allow users to view their own orders (both authenticated and guest)
-- For guest users, they can view orders using order_number and email
CREATE POLICY "Users can view orders by email and order number" ON orders
    FOR SELECT USING (
        auth.uid() = user_id OR 
        (user_id IS NULL AND customer_email IS NOT NULL)
    );

-- Allow viewing order items for orders that the user can view
CREATE POLICY "Users can view order items for accessible orders" ON order_items
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM orders 
            WHERE orders.id = order_items.order_id 
            AND (
                orders.user_id = auth.uid() OR 
                (orders.user_id IS NULL AND orders.customer_email IS NOT NULL)
            )
        )
    );

-- Grant necessary permissions for the service role
GRANT INSERT ON orders TO service_role;
GRANT INSERT ON order_items TO service_role;
GRANT UPDATE ON product_variants TO service_role;
GRANT UPDATE ON coupons TO service_role;

SELECT 'Migration 002_fix_order_rls_policies completed successfully! üéâ' as result;
```

### Step 3: Apply User Profile Trigger (if not already applied)
```sql
-- Function to handle new user profile creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email, full_name, phone)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', ''),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'phone', '')
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Trigger to automatically create user profile when user signs up
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

### Step 4: Verify the Migration
Run this query to verify everything is working:

```sql
-- Check if policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('orders', 'order_items')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity, forcerowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('orders', 'order_items');

-- Test order creation (this should not fail)
SELECT 'Database is ready for order creation!' as status;
```

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Guest Checkout
1. Open your website in incognito mode
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Fill address details
5. Select payment method (COD or Online)
6. Place order
7. **Expected**: Order should be created successfully

### Test 2: Authenticated User Checkout
1. Login to your account
2. Add items to cart
3. Complete checkout process
4. **Expected**: Order should be created successfully

### Test 3: Order Lookup
1. Try to view orders as guest user
2. Try to view orders as authenticated user
3. **Expected**: Users should only see their own orders

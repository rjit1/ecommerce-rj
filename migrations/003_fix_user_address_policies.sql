-- MIGRATION: Fix User Address RLS Policies
-- Version: 003
-- Date: 2024-12-19
-- Description: Ensure user_addresses table has proper RLS policies
--              for both INSERT and other operations
-- =============================================

-- Drop existing user address policies to recreate them
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own addresses" ON user_addresses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all user addresses" ON user_addresses;

-- Create comprehensive policies for user addresses
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own addresses" ON user_addresses
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own addresses" ON user_addresses
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own addresses" ON user_addresses
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own addresses" ON user_addresses
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admin policies for user addresses
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all user addresses" ON user_addresses
    FOR SELECT USING (is_admin());

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all user addresses" ON user_addresses
    FOR ALL USING (is_admin());

-- Verify the table exists and has the correct structure
